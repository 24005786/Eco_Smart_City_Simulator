The Energy Distibution System is a multi-paradigm software solution which manages energy distribution from various sources such as wind, solar and hydro. It determines energy production and demand, prioritises distribution, and stores excess energy to ensure a consistent supply. This README summarises the system's purpose, features, usage as well as future improvements that could be made. 

This project simulates an energy distribution system using object-orientated programming as well as procedural programming examples, supporting the following functions:
- Effectively manage energy sources (solar,wind, and hydro).
- Calculate and distibute energy according to real-time demand and availability.
- When demand is low and supply is high, store the excess supply.
- Enable the dynamic addition as well as removal of energy sources.

Its features include:
- Energy production management - gather and initialise energy data from multiple sources.
- Real-time demand matching - constantly matches energy production to demand, distributing energy according to priority needs.
- Energy storage - when production exceeds demand, surplus energy is stored for late use.
- Dynamic source management - enables users to add and remove energy sources as needed.

Its usage encompasses:
- Initialising energy sources - the system will ask to enter production data for solar, wind, and hydro sources.
- Monitor real-time distribution - the system calculates total energy production, matches it to its demand, and distributes it in priority order.
- Add/remove sources - use the prompts to dynamically add or remove energy sources as required.
- Display statistics - continuous statistics provide real-time insights into energy distribution, demand matching, and stored energy.

Future improvements:
- AI-based demand prediction - use machine learning to forecast future energy demand and optimise production accordingly.
- Real-time visualisation - use graphical tools to see trends in production, demand, and distribution.
- Expand energy sources - support for more renewable sources, such as bioenergy, and non-renewable sources like coal.
